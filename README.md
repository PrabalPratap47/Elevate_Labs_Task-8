Create a Simple Blog Layout Using Bootstrap 5
This task involved building a responsive blog layout using Bootstrap 5. Bootstrap and Bootstrap Icons were included via CDN links in the HTML file. A navbar with branding and navigation links was created, followed by a set of blog post cards arranged using Bootstrap’s grid system. Each card included an image, title, description, and a “Read More” button. A footer with social media icons was added and positioned to always stay at the bottom of the page using Bootstrap’s flex utilities. Styling was applied using Bootstrap’s built-in classes such as img-fluid, shadow, rounded, d-flex, and text-center, eliminating the need for custom CSS. This task demonstrated efficient use of Bootstrap for rapid and responsive UI development.
